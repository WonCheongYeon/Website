abstract: This study examines the impact of female missionaries and native Protestants on women's political engagement during the colonial era in Korea, focusing on the role of female Protestants referred to as "Bible women." By analysing data from the archive of Patriots and Veterans Affairs and information on Bible women at the county level, we assess the effect of their influence. Our results provide evidence of a positive relationship between the presence and influence of Bible women and higher levels of engagement in the independence movement during the Japanese colonial period in Korea. This research contributes to our understanding of how female Protestants played a crucial role in promoting women's political participation in historical contexts. The findings underscore the significance of Bible women as agents of social change and empowerment for Korean women during this era.
